Standardization is like adjusting scores on a test so that all students are graded on the same scale. It doesn’t matter if one test was tougher than the other, the scores are adjusted so we can compare them fairly.

Normalization, on the other hand, is like converting all students’ heights to a scale from 0 (the shortest student) to 1 (the tallest student). This way, it’s easier to compare and understand the heights of different students.
